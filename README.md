# Detect-single-neuronal-cells-in-microscopy-images
Overview
In this challenge, your task is to detect and segment individual neuronal cells from fluorescence microscopy images. The dataset consists of grayscale cell images with complex structures and overlapping instances, and the goal is to generate pixel-accurate masks for each cell in the image.
